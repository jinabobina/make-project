# Our project is named “Color the US.” We wanted to challenge ourselves while utilizing the class materials. In class, we have created numerous user-interactive games in Python Shell and Greenfoot, so we wanted to develop a more complex game using visuals through Graphic User Interface (GUI) and choropleth maps with Plotly. GUI allows users to interact through graphic icons and visual indicators, and we used python for our game on the Visual Studio Code platform. As this class is the first time coding for both of us, we wanted to expand from the learning materials done in class. To be original, we started from scratch and worked our way up. With the appropriate libraries imported in the computer, players will be able to access the game offline.
